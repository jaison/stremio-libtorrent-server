# 🎬 stremio-libtorrent-server

### Seu servidor Stremio pessoal, com armazenamento local persistente e controle sobre o torrent.

Este fork é preparado principalmente para **Coolify**: o Web Player, a Library UI e o motor
BitTorrent rodam no mesmo container, com volume persistente e configuração declarativa em
`compose.yaml`.

É um **cliente torrent completo**, não apenas um streamer: pode baixar arquivos para o servidor,
manter títulos escolhidos com **Keep** e reproduzi-los pelo Stremio. No preset deste fork, downloads
terminados **não continuam em seeding automaticamente**; itens marcados como Keep continuam sendo
mantidos e podem continuar compartilhando.

## ✨ O que este fork entrega

- **☁️ Pronto para Coolify.** O `compose.yaml` define serviço, volume persistente, healthcheck e a porta BitTorrent.
- **📺 Web Player integrado.** O Stremio Web roda no mesmo domínio configurado no Coolify.
- **📚 Library UI habilitada.** Baixe títulos antes de assistir, acompanhe episódios e use **Keep** para protegê-los da limpeza do cache.
- **💾 Cache controlado.** O preset começa com `STREMIOSRV_CACHE_SIZE=10GB`.
- **🛑 Sem seeding automático.** `STREMIOSRV_SEED_ON_COMPLETE=false` no preset; Keep é a ação explícita para manter um item.
- **⚡ libtorrent aberto.** Inbound peers, download sequencial orientado ao playhead e controle fino do comportamento.
- **🖥️ Transcode opcional.** CPU por padrão, com VAAPI/NVENC quando o host/container fornecer a aceleração.

## 🚀 Quick Start — Coolify

Use o **Docker Compose** diretamente deste repositório.

### 1. Criar a aplicação

Em um projeto do Coolify, crie uma aplicação a partir de:

```text
jaison/stremio-libtorrent-server
branch: main
Build Pack: Docker Compose
Compose: /compose.yaml
Base Directory: /
```

### 2. Domínio

Associe seu domínio à porta interna **8080**:

```text
https://stremio.seudominio.com  →  8080
```

O HTTPS externo é terminado pelo proxy do Coolify.

### 3. Environment Variables

O `compose.yaml` já traz os defaults deste fork. No Coolify, defina apenas o domínio público:

```env
SERVER_URL=https://stremio.seudominio.com
```

Os defaults são:

```env
STREMIOSRV_CACHE_SIZE=10GB
STREMIOSRV_LIBRARY_UI=true
STREMIOSRV_SEED_ON_COMPLETE=false
STREMIOSRV_ENABLE_UPNP=false
```

Não configure `IPADDRESS` no Coolify.

### 4. Storage

O volume persistente já está declarado no Compose:

```yaml
stremio-cache:/root/.stremio-server
```

Não é necessário criar esse mount manualmente no painel.

### 5. BitTorrent

O Compose publica:

```text
6881/TCP
6881/UDP
```

Essas portas permitem inbound peers. Playback e downloads também funcionam sem inbound.

### 6. Abrir

Depois do deploy:

```text
https://stremio.seudominio.com/
https://stremio.seudominio.com/library/
```

Para a configuração completa do Coolify, veja [`docs/COOLIFY.md`](docs/COOLIFY.md).

### Docker fora do Coolify

O projeto continua compatível com Docker Compose convencional e com os overlays de GPU.
A configuração principal permanece em [`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml).

## 🧰 Minimum hardware

It's light — direct play (most content) barely touches the CPU; the GPU only matters for transcoding.

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | 2 cores, x86-64 | 4+ cores | `amd64` only. Transcoding (clients that can't direct-play) is the only heavy load. |
| **RAM** | 1 GB | 2 GB+ | Engine + buffers + nginx; transcoding adds ~0.5–1 GB. |
| **Disk** | ~3 GB + cache | SSD, cache ≥ largest file | Image ~1.5 GB; download cache defaults to **18 GiB** (tune with `STREMIOSRV_CACHE_SIZE`). Keep free space ≥ your biggest single file. |
| **GPU** | none | Intel VAAPI / NVIDIA NVENC | Optional — only speeds up transcoding; a missing/broken GPU never blocks startup. |
| **Network** | any | wired + `6881` forwarded | Wired beats Wi-Fi for 4K; forward port `6881` for the full swarm (see below). |

---

## 📺 On your TV

Smart TVs insist on a **trusted** HTTPS connection — a self-signed cert won't do. Set `IPADDRESS`
and this server fetches a real Let's Encrypt certificate for you automatically (via Stremio's
`*.stremio.rocks` magic DNS, which maps that long URL back to your server's IP — even on your LAN).
In the TV's Stremio app, set the **Streaming Server URL** to the `…stremio.rocks:12470` address shown
by `docker logs stremio`.

> **Note — the Stremio _desktop_ app (v6).** The desktop shell launches its own bundled streaming
> server and re‑points itself at `127.0.0.1:11470` on **every** start — it injects a
> `?streamingServerUrl=` parameter that overwrites the saved URL — so simply setting the Streaming
> Server URL doesn't stick. (This is the shell's behaviour, not a `serverVersion` gate — that part is
> already correct.) Two ways to use **this** box from the desktop:
>
> - **Best — launch with a flag** *(native player, full MKV/HEVC):* start Stremio with
>   `--development --webui-url=<your …stremio.rocks:12470 URL>` (the trusted URL from
>   `docker logs stremio`). A non‑default `--webui-url` skips the localhost injection and loads the
>   player from this box; `--development` also skips the unused bundled server. Add the flag to your
>   shortcut and launch from it each time. It **must** be the **trusted** `:12470` URL — a self‑signed
>   cert is refused. After signing into your account, relaunch via the shortcut (login resets the URL).
> - **Zero‑install** *(MP4/H.264 only):* open the `:12470` URL in a browser, or install it as an app.
>
> **TVs are unaffected** — Samsung/LG accept the `:12470` URL directly and it sticks.

**Styled subtitles on the TV.** A Stremio TV app built on stremio-video 0.0.97 or later can draw a
file's own ASS/SSA subtitles with their styling and fonts, instead of as plain text. Turn on the
player's ASS subtitles styling setting: each styled track then shows as a second entry, marked
**(styled)**, next to the TV's plain one. The server reads only the stretch being watched, a minute
at a time, and the TV's own playback keeps priority over it. Older TV apps keep their plain
subtitles.

## 🌍 Want the *full* swarm? Forward one port.

A lot of BitTorrent's speed comes from peers reaching **you** — and home routers block that by
default. For maximum peers and throughput, **forward port `6881` (TCP *and* UDP)** on your router to
your server. It works fine without forwarding — you'll just reach fewer peers on sparse torrents.
(Unlike the stock server, this one actually *listens* for inbound peers, so the forward genuinely pays off.)

---

## 🔐 Run behind a VPN

Tunnel only the streaming server's BitTorrent traffic through a VPN (kill-switch + optional
port-forwarding) using [gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun), while your LAN keeps reaching the
player/admin directly:

```bash
WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY=... WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES=10.2.0.2/32 IPADDRESS=<your-LAN-IP> \
  docker compose -f compose.vpn.yaml up -d
```

Notes:
- The VPN's **kill-switch** is on by default — if the tunnel drops, torrent traffic stops (no IP leak).
- **Inbound peers / seeding** need a provider that supports **port-forwarding** (e.g. ProtonVPN, PIA,
  AirVPN). Without it you still stream, but with outbound-only connectivity.
- Set `FIREWALL_OUTBOUND_SUBNETS` to your LAN CIDR(s) so the player and admin stay reachable.

---

## 🔧 Advanced — tune it your way

Everything is a plain `-e NAME=value` environment variable:

> **Sizes and rates accept units.** `64GiB`, `512MiB`, `1.5GiB`, `2MiB` — or a plain byte count, which is what these have always taken and still do. Note `GiB` is binary while `GB`/`G` are decimal (`64G` is ~4.4 GiB *less* than `64GiB`), and a lowercase `b` does not mean bits: these are bytes, and the rate limits are bytes per second.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `IPADDRESS` | *(unset)* | Usado apenas pelo caminho de certificado `*.stremio.rocks`; deixe vazio no Coolify. |
| `SERVER_URL` | *(Coolify: defina)* | URL pública usada pelo Web Player. Ex.: `https://stremio.exemplo.com`. |
| `STREMIOSRV_CACHE_SIZE` | `10GB` no preset Coolify | Limite do cache de downloads. Ajuste no Coolify; mantenha-o acima do maior arquivo que pretende baixar. |
| `STREMIOSRV_CACHE_EVICT_GRACE` | `1800` | Seconds a torrent stays safe from eviction after it was last served. Raise it if a player buffers long enough between range requests that the title being watched ages out. |
| `STREMIOSRV_RESUME_RETENTION_DAYS` | `365` | How long a fast-resume record is kept for a title that has left the cache. The record carries the torrent's metadata, so re-playing an evicted title starts without fetching it from the swarm again — this only bounds the directory. A title still cached, kept, or downloading is exempt at any age. `0` keeps everything. |
| `STREMIOSRV_TRANSCODE_GC_INTERVAL` | `60` | Seconds between transcode housekeeping passes: end encoders nobody is reading, then sweep the directories they leave behind. `transcode/` is exempt from cache eviction, so this is the only thing that reclaims it. |
| `STREMIOSRV_TRANSCODE_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Seconds a transcode may go unread before its `ffmpeg` is ended. A player that crashes, refuses the stream, or loses its connection never calls `/destroy`, and the encoder left behind holds a GPU as firmly as a wanted one. Raise it if you pause for long stretches — resuming after a reap re-transcodes from the start; `0` disables the reaper. |
| `STREMIOSRV_TRANSCODE_GC_MAX_AGE` | `600` | Grace before an *unclaimed* transcode directory is deleted. A job with a live `ffmpeg` is kept no matter how old. Raise it only if you pause transcoded playback for long stretches. |
| `STREMIOSRV_READAHEAD_BYTES` | `268435456` (256 MiB) | Playhead buffer — bigger absorbs more swarm jitter (fewer rebuffers). |
| `STREMIOSRV_STREAM_PIECE_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Seconds a request waits for one piece **mid-stream** before ending the stream (the player then re-requests). Raise it on a slow or thinly-peered swarm where the piece does arrive, just late — but it cuts both ways: when the piece is never coming, this is how long playback freezes before the retry that would have recovered it. |
| `STREMIOSRV_STREAM_FIRST_PIECE_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Same, for the **first** piece of a request — a cold start: the beginning of playback, or a seek into a region nothing has downloaded yet. |
| `STREMIOSRV_BT_LISTEN_PORT` | `6881` | BitTorrent peer port (TCP **and** UDP, IPv4 **and** IPv6). The one to forward. **If you change it, publish the *same* port** — the compose files and `docker/launch.sh` follow this var automatically; a hand-rolled `docker run` must use matching `-p <port>:<port>/tcp -p <port>:<port>/udp` (mapping to a *different* container port silently kills inbound peering). |
| `STREMIOSRV_ENABLE_UPNP` | `true` | Ask the router to auto-forward the BitTorrent port via **UPnP** and **NAT-PMP**. `false` stops both mappers — set it when you forward the port yourself, forward nothing on purpose (LAN-only), or tunnel the server's traffic, so it stops asking the router for a mapping it does not need. Peer discovery (DHT, local service discovery) is unaffected. |
| `STREMIOSRV_BT_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `400` | Max peer connections. |
| `STREMIOSRV_DOWNLOAD_RATE_LIMIT` | `0` | Cap download throughput in **bytes/sec** (`0` = unlimited). E.g. `12500000` ≈ 100 Mbit/s. |
| `STREMIOSRV_UPLOAD_RATE_LIMIT` | `0` | Cap upload throughput in **bytes/sec** (`0` = unlimited). Handy so seeding doesn't saturate your line. |
| `STREMIOSRV_IDLE_DOWNLOAD_RATE_LIMIT` | `1048576` (1 MiB/s) | **Cross-torrent playback priority.** While *anything* is being streamed, every *other* (idle) torrent is capped to this many bytes/sec so the torrent you're watching wins the bandwidth. `0` disables it (idle torrents compete freely). |
| `STREMIOSRV_MAX_STREAMS` | `0` | Max **concurrent playbacks** (distinct torrents being streamed). A new play past the cap gets `503`. `0` = unlimited. |
| `STREMIOSRV_SEED_ON_COMPLETE` | `false` no preset Coolify | Para o seeding ao concluir. `true` mantém o comportamento de cliente torrent; itens com Keep continuam protegidos. |
| `STREMIOSRV_MAX_SEED_MINUTES` | `0` | Stop seeding this many **minutes after completion** (`0` = seed forever). Applies on top of `SEED_ON_COMPLETE`. |
| `STREMIOSRV_EXTRA_TRACKERS` | *(empty)* | Extra trackers appended to **every** torrent (on top of the built-in defaults). Comma/space/newline-separated `udp://`/`http(s)://`/`ws(s)://` URLs. |
| `STREMIOSRV_TRACKER_LIST_URL` | *(empty)* | Optional URL of a community tracker list (e.g. the raw [ngosang/trackerslist](https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist) `trackers_best.txt`). Fetched in a **background thread** to keep the list current — best-effort, **never blocks startup or playback**; offline falls back to the last cached list, then the built-in defaults. Empty = fully static. |
| `STREMIOSRV_TRACKER_LIST_REFRESH_HOURS` | `24` | How often the background tracker-list source re-fetches (only when a URL is set). |
| `STREMIOSRV_DHT_BOOTSTRAP_NODES` | *(empty)* | Your own DHT entry points, `host:port,host:port`. Empty keeps libtorrent's built-in routers. Only used on a **first** boot — after that the server rejoins via its saved routing table (see below). |
| `STREMIOSRV_ADAPTIVE_PICKING` | `false` | **Experimental.** While playing, relax strict sequential download to parallel once enough is buffered ahead of the playhead (harvests more swarm throughput), re-tightening to in-order when the buffer drains or on a seek — the playhead window stays deadline-rushed, so continuity is protected. Off by default; needs on-box tuning. |
| `STREMIOSRV_PREFETCH_NEXT` | `false` | **Next-episode prefetch (opt-in).** Once you are into the last 10% of an episode **and** that episode is fully downloaded, quietly pull the start of the next episode in the same torrent so pressing Next starts instantly. Only applies to multi-episode packs — see below. |
| `STREMIOSRV_PREFETCH_NEXT_FRACTION` | `0.05` | How much of the next episode to fetch, as a fraction of its size. |
| `STREMIOSRV_PREFETCH_NEXT_MAX_BYTES` | `134217728` (128 MiB) | Ceiling on that head, so a very large episode doesn't pull 200 MB. |
| `STREMIOSRV_PREFETCH_TRIGGER_FRACTION` | `0.90` | How far into the current episode the trigger sits. |
| `STREMIOSRV_LIBRARY_UI` | `false` | **Opt-in download manager** at `/library` on the same origin as the web player: browse your Stremio library, download a title in full, and manage what is on disk as titles rather than folder names. Off by default — it is an authenticated page, so enabling it is a deliberate choice. See [docs/library-ui.md](docs/library-ui.md). |
| `STREMIOSRV_LIBRARY_ADDON_ALLOW` | *(unset)* | Which client addresses count as your own network. They may reach the library addon, and `/proxy` (which plays addon streams that need their own request headers) fetches any address for them but a link-local or cloud-metadata one, while other clients — and web pages on other sites — may fetch public addresses only. A web page counts as the server's own, not another site, when it was opened on an IP address in these ranges, or on the server's own host or `SERVER_URL`'s. Unset means loopback, private ranges, link-local, IPv6 ULA and carrier-grade NAT (so a private tunnel still works). Comma-separated CIDRs to replace that list. **Clients can look local when they are not:** behind a reverse proxy every client arrives from the proxy's address, and on a host with IPv6 whose container network has none, Docker forwards IPv6 clients from its bridge gateway. In either case list your own LAN ranges here explicitly. Subtitle and transcode routes that take a media URL apply the same destination rule as the proxy, and never let ffmpeg open an outside URL directly. |
| `STREMIOSRV_LIBRARY_OWNER` | *(unset)* | Which Stremio account may use it — the account id or its email. Unset = the **first** account to sign in claims the server. |
| `STREMIOSRV_LIBRARY_ALLOW_HTTP` | `false` | Allow the library UI without TLS. Its session cookie is `Secure`, so plain HTTP is refused unless you set this — only do so on a trusted LAN or behind a VPN. |
| `DOMAIN` | `localhost` | CN for the self-signed cert (when not using `IPADDRESS`). |
| `CERT_FILE` | `certificates.pem` | Bring-your-own cert (full-chain + key) filename in the data volume. |

**Trackers & peer discovery.** Every torrent is announced to a curated set of public trackers (baked-in
defaults) **plus DHT, LSD and PEX** — so a bare infohash finds peers even when the magnet carries no
tracker, exactly like the stock Stremio server. Extend it two ways: add your own with
`STREMIOSRV_EXTRA_TRACKERS`, or point `STREMIOSRV_TRACKER_LIST_URL` at a maintained list (e.g.
[ngosang/trackerslist](https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist)) to keep the set current — that fetch
runs in a background thread and **never blocks startup or playback** (offline → last cached list → the
built-in defaults). The bigger peering win, though, is **inbound connectivity**: forward
`STREMIOSRV_BT_LISTEN_PORT` (6881) so you reach the whole swarm, not just what trackers hand back.

**Your node remembers the network.** Joining the DHT needs an entry point, and with nothing saved
that means a handful of bootstrap routers run by other people — every reboot, forever. So the
server writes its DHT routing table to `<cache>/dht.state` (every 30s, and on shutdown) and
restores it on start. A machine that has been online even once rejoins through hundreds of peers it
already knows, with nobody else's server in the path. That matters most for a box that sits powered
off for months and then gets plugged back in. A corrupt or missing file is not an error — it just
falls back to a normal cold start. Set `STREMIOSRV_DHT_BOOTSTRAP_NODES` if you would rather not use
the built-in routers for that first boot either.

**Next-episode prefetch** (opt-in, off by default) pulls the head of the next episode in a pack so *Next* starts instantly — see [the full description on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewhack/stremio-libtorrent-server#next-episode-prefetch).

### Watch your library inside Stremio

Turning on the library page also publishes it as a **Stremio addon**, so what is on the box shows up
in the app itself: a **My Library** row on your board, and a **play the local copy** entry in the
stream list next to every other source. It is read-only — keeping, removing and starting downloads
stay on the page, because the addon protocol has no way to express an action.

**Installing it — four steps:**

1. Start the server with `STREMIOSRV_LIBRARY_UI=true` (it is off by default, and so is the addon).
2. Open **`https://<your-server>:12470/library/`** and sign in with your Stremio account.
3. At the top of that page, under **"Watch this library in Stremio"**, press **Copy**. That
   gives you a URL of the shape
   `https://<your-server>:12470/library/addon/<token>/manifest.json` — the token is unique to your
   server, and the URL **must end in `/manifest.json`**.
4. In Stremio: **Addons → Add addon**, paste, install.

**Where to look for it.** On the board it is a row titled *My Library*. On a film or episode
page it is a source in the right-hand list — at the **bottom**, below your other addons: the
app groups streams by addon in install order and the protocol has no way to ask for a
position. With a couple of torrent addons installed that can be a dozen rows down, so scroll.

**Which titles get that row.** Anything you download from the library page, and anything you play
in the app — from any addon — once it has been playing for a moment: the app tells the addon which
title and which file it is playing, and the addon records that for the copy on disk. A title that
was already on disk gets its row the next time it is played. *Installed the addon before 1.6.5?*
Remove it and add it again once — the app keeps the capabilities it read at install time, and this
one is new.

> Paste the address of the library **page** (`…/library/`) and Stremio will report
> *"Failed to fetch: expected value at line 1 column 1"* — it asked for a manifest and got the HTML
> of the page. Copy the link from the panel rather than from the address bar.

Install it once on any device signed into your Stremio account and it syncs to the others, so a TV
inherits it without anyone typing a URL. That convenience is also why the addon refuses requests from
outside your network: the install URL and its token come to rest in your Stremio account, so the
token alone is not treated as the boundary. Both a wrong token and an outside address get the same
404 as a route that does not exist.

Two things worth knowing before you judge what you see:

- **Titles you merely watched have no poster and show a folder name.** A title the app plays is
  learned for its own page — its **My Library** entry offers the very file that played — but only a
  download started from the library page tells the server a title's name and poster, so a watched
  title's card on the board shows the name of the folder on disk.
- **Rotating the link breaks existing installs**, which is the point of the **New link** button next
  to Copy — it is how you take back a URL that has spread further than you meant.

### Next-episode prefetch

Off by default. With `STREMIOSRV_PREFETCH_NEXT=true`, the server watches how much of the current
episode's stream has been **read** and whether that episode is completely downloaded. Once reads pass
90% **and** the episode is complete, it fetches the first 5% of the next video file in the same
torrent (plus its last 4 MiB, so a trailing MP4 index doesn't stall the switch) at low background
priority, then stops. Pressing Next starts from cache instead of from the swarm; the rest of the
episode then downloads normally.

Only one of those two conditions is a hard guarantee. Completeness is: prefetch can never take
bandwidth from what you're watching, because by the time it runs that file needs none. The 90% mark
is a best-effort proxy — bytes read, not where the viewer actually is — so a player that probes the
end of the file on open (e.g. to read a trailing MP4 index) can satisfy it within the first seconds of
an episode. That earliness is bounded (it can only ever pull the same small head+tail, never more) and
harmless (the completeness gate still holds); it's just occasionally sooner than the 90% figure implies.

**Scope:** this covers multi-episode **packs** — one torrent holding several episodes. When each
episode is its own torrent, the next one's infohash has never been sent to the server (the streaming
protocol carries only an infohash and a file index), so there is nothing to prefetch. A torrent with
a single video file has no "next file" and is unaffected, which is how films opt out automatically.

**One side effect:** with `STREMIOSRV_SEED_ON_COMPLETE=false`, a completed torrent is normally
paused. Prefetch resumes it for as long as the head takes to arrive — so it will seed again briefly
— and the seeding policy pauses it once more afterwards. With `STREMIOSRV_SEED_ON_COMPLETE=true` and
`STREMIOSRV_MAX_SEED_MINUTES` set, arming has a quieter version of the same effect: the torrent is
briefly "not finished" again while the head downloads, which resets the seed-time clock. A torrent
already most of the way through its seed window gets that clock restarted, and can end up seeding up
to `MAX_SEED_MINUTES` longer than expected after the head lands.

**GPU transcode** (only for clients that can't direct-play). Docker does **not** expose the host GPU to a
container by default, so the one-command install above is **CPU-only**. The server *auto-detects* a GPU,
but only one you've handed in — so opt in at launch:
- **Intel/AMD VAAPI** → add `--device /dev/dri:/dev/dri`
- **NVIDIA NVENC** → add `--gpus all` (requires the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) on the host)
- **Or just use [`docker/launch.sh`](docker/launch.sh)** — it probes the host and adds the right flags for you,
  degrading gracefully (a broken or absent driver never blocks startup). Full NVIDIA driver + **Proxmox
  passthrough** setup: [NVIDIA-GPU.md](https://github.com/andrewhack/stremio-docker/blob/main/NVIDIA-GPU.md) (companion fork).

**Your own domain instead of stremio.rocks:** put a full-chain+key PEM as `certificates.pem` in the
data volume, set `-e SERVER_URL=https://yourdomain:12470`, and leave `IPADDRESS` unset.

**Tailscale (zero port-forwarding, trusted HTTPS):** if you reach the server over a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
tailnet, you can skip both port-forwarding *and* the `*.stremio.rocks` dependency. Provision a cert for the
node's MagicDNS name (`tailscale cert <node>.<tailnet>.ts.net`), concatenate the cert + key into one PEM,
drop it in the data volume as `certificates.pem`, and set `-e SERVER_URL=https://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:12470`
with `IPADDRESS` unset. Point your devices' Stremio **Streaming Server URL** at that tailnet address — works
across your own devices and anyone you share the tailnet with, with a browser/TV-trusted cert.

**Ports:** `8080` web+API (HTTP/LAN) · `12470` web+API (HTTPS) · `11470` direct API · `6881` BitTorrent.

## 🧠 Why it exists

The stock Stremio streaming server is closed-source and, in practice:
- **outbound-only** — it never listens for inbound peers, so you only reach the connectable half of a swarm;
- it **hides the torrent levers** — no real control over piece picking, connectivity, or cache.

This opens it up: **inbound connectivity + playhead-first piece picking** for faster starts and better
reliability on sparse swarms, **plus** hardware transcode for clients that can't direct-play — all in
an image you run yourself. It is **content-neutral infrastructure**: it streams whatever infohash a
Stremio *addon* hands it, and bundles or surfaces nothing.

## 🏗️ Under the hood

One image, two source repos. The runtime image is built **`FROM`** a GPU/ffmpeg base (the companion
fork) and layers the open server on top:

```
┌─────────────── stremio-docker-dual  (companion fork, MIT) ──────────────┐
│ jellyfin-ffmpeg (NVENC/VAAPI) · nginx · bundled Stremio web player        │
└───────────────────────────────▲──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                 │ FROM
┌─────────────── stremio-libtorrent-server  (this repo) ──────────────────┐
│ FastAPI + libtorrent engine · nginx serves web player + proxies the API   │
│ → one container: web player + open engine on a single origin              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

How the TV HTTPS URL works (`*.stremio.rocks`), and the shared third-party hostname it relies on, are explained in the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewhack/stremio-libtorrent-server#-appendix--how-the-tv-https-url-works-stremiorocks).

## 🔐 Appendix — how the TV HTTPS URL works (`*.stremio.rocks`)

*Skip this unless you're curious or customizing certs — the Quick Start needs none of it.*

When you set `IPADDRESS`, the container prints a TV-ready HTTPS URL like:

```
https://192-168-1-50.519b6502d940.stremio.rocks:12470
        └────┬─────┘ └────┬─────┘ └─────┬─────┘ └─┬─┘
          your IP,     shared ID     Stremio's    HTTPS
          dashed       (see below)   free DNS     port
```

- **`192-168-1-50`** — your server's IP with dots turned into dashes.
- **`…stremio.rocks`** — a free service Stremio runs that (a) resolves `<dashed-ip>.…stremio.rocks`
  back to that IP (even a LAN IP — no DNS setup by you), and (b) carries a **trusted Let's Encrypt
  wildcard cert**, so TVs/browsers accept the HTTPS connection with no warning.
- **`:12470`** — the container's HTTPS port.

A TV opening it → resolves to your server's IP → connects on `12470` → sees a trusted cert → connects.
The name resolves to your **internal** IP, so the TV must be on the **same network** (normal home
setup). For **remote** access, use your **public** IP in the URL and forward port `12470`.

### About `519b6502d940` — a shared, third-party dependency

This ID belongs to **Stremio's own certificate service**, not to any docker image: the cert is fetched
from Stremio's API (`api.strem.io/api/certificateGet`), which issues it for a subdomain of Stremio's
`stremio.rocks` domain. It is **not unique to your install** — everyone running this (or the upstream
[tsaridas/stremio-docker](https://github.com/tsaridas/stremio-docker)) image shares the same
`*.519b6502d940.stremio.rocks` wildcard cert from **Stremio's free certificate service**. The image
only *calls* that Stremio API; it didn't create the ID.

- ✅ Zero-config trusted HTTPS for TVs.
- ⚠️ It depends on Stremio's cert service keeping that wildcard alive; if it's ever rotated or taken
  down, the automatic cert path stops working (your stream still runs — only the trusted-HTTPS URL is affected).

**Independent fallback — bring your own cert** (no reliance on stremio.rocks): put a full-chain + key
PEM as `certificates.pem` in the data volume, set `-e SERVER_URL=https://yourdomain:12470`, and **leave
`IPADDRESS` unset** — the server uses your cert as-is. Or, on a trusted LAN, skip HTTPS entirely and
use `http://<your-server-ip>:8080`.
