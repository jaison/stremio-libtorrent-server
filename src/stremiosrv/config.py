    """Runtime configuration. Overridable via STREMIOSRV_* env vars, except `server_url`, which reads
    the container's unprefixed SERVER_URL.

    Every size and rate below is a `ByteSize`, so it accepts a plain byte count (what every existing
    compose file and the appliance image already pass — those keep working unchanged) or a suffixed
    string: `64GiB`, `512MiB`, `1.5GiB`, `2MiB`. Two things about the suffixes are worth knowing
    before typing one, because both are easy to get wrong and neither fails loudly:

    * **`GiB` is binary, `GB`/`G` are decimal.** `64GiB` is 68,719,476,736 bytes; `64G` is
      64,000,000,000 — about 4.4 GiB less than most people mean by "64 gig". Prefer the `i` forms.
    * **`b` never means bits.** Parsing is case-insensitive, so `Gb` and `GB` are the same thing.
      That matters most on the rate limits, which are bytes/second while network speeds are habitually
      quoted in bits: `100Mb` here is 100 MB/s, not a 100 Mbit line.

    Anything unparseable is a startup error, not a silent default — a mistyped budget should stop the
    server, not quietly run with 18 GiB.
